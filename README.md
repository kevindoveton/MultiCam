# MultiCam
MultiCam is a virtual camera that combines the physical web cameras on your system, it then 
uses face detection to switch to the camera that you are looking at.

Based on the great examples from [seanchas116](https://github.com/seanchas116/SimpleDALPlugin) and [johnboiles](https://github.com/johnboiles/coremediaio-dal-minimal-example).

## How to run

* Build MultiCam in Xcode
* Copy MultiCam.plugin into `/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL`
* Open Webcam using app and choose MultiCam as camera input
